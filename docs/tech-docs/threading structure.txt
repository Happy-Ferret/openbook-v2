THREADS

1. FROTZ - interpreting continuously
2. GLUTTER - displaying continuously, call through to shape

INPUT

When frotz needs input it queries a static input object.
When glutter detects input, it alters the static input object.

CREATION

When frotz draws some text, it does so through some print logic.
The print logic records a script and calls the DisplayUmbrella's incoming text method.

The DisplayUmbrella processes the incoming text, creating new objects.

DisplayUmbrellas implement:
	addText(char*)
	addText(string*)
	addChar(char)
	display()
	animate(time)

DisplayShapes implement:
	animate(time)
	display()


During initialisation, the Umbrella registers itself with the Print logic.

DISPLAY

The glutter displays animations by calling the DisplayUmbrella display method. (and any other backdroppy stuff that needs doing, etc. - perhaps a list of DisplayUmbrellas...)

Book   : DisplayUmbrella
Page   : DisplayUmbrella
Line   : DisplayUmbrella
Letter : DisplayShape

Internal logics of Book include some additional objects:
	Book is responsible for managing display state of Pages - 
	ie. only display appropriate.
	Pages generate, store and display Lines. Also handle rotation of page.
	Lines store and display letters.

Book also stores initial page size and parameters. Used to create the first page. Doubly linked list constructed from pages? Better...
